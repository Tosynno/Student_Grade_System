Student Grade System" and provided a context of Week 3 focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, I'll assume you're looking for guidance or an implementation for the Student Grade System mini-project, leveraging OOP concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, and potentially inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, as outlined in your Week 3 goals. If you have specific requirements (e.g., features, input/output format, or complexity), please clarify, and I can tailor the response further.
Student Grade System Mini Project
Objective: Create a Java program to manage student grades using OOP principles. The system should:

Store student information (e.g., name, ID, grades).
Calculate the average grade.
Determine a letter grade based on the average.
Display student details and results.

This implementation will incorporate:

Classes & Objects (Day 15): Define a Student class and create objects.
Constructors (Day 16): Use constructors to initialize student data.
Encapsulation (Day 17): Use private fields with getters and setters.
(Optional) Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction (Days 18â€“20): Can be added if you want a more advanced system (e.g., different types of students or grading systems).

Java Implementation
Below is a simple, well-structured Java program for the Student Grade System using OOP principles.
